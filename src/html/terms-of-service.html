              The cost of this year’s trip will be $1320.00*. The price includes
              round trip airfare, hotel accommodations, and all meals, entrance
              fees to highlighted locations, ground transportation and
              gratuities. While this is not a school sponsored trip, the
              students are chaperoned by school district personnel at all times.
              The trip is scheduled for Sunday, May 30 through Wednesday, June 2
              or Monday, May 31 through Thursday, June 3. A meeting will be held
              in mid-May to inform parents of final details about packing,
              assigned flights, medical release forms, etc. We look forward to
              your participation.
